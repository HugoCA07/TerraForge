# TerraForge
TerraForge 🌍⚔️ TerraForge is a 2D sandbox adventure game and engine built from the ground up in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The project focuses on procedural world generation, survival mechanics, and efficient real-time rendering.

🚀 Core Features
Procedural World Generation: Infinite (or semi-infinite) worlds created using Noise algorithms (Perlin/Simplex) for realistic biomes.

Custom ECS Architecture: A clean Entity Component System to manage players, NPCs, and environmental objects efficiently.

Physics & Collisions: Optimized AABB collision detection and spatial partitioning (Quadtrees) for smooth performance.

Dynamic Day/Night Cycle: Ambient lighting system implemented via SFML shaders.

Crafting & Inventory: A robust system for resource gathering, item management, and world interaction.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C++17 / C++20

Graphics & Media: SFML

Build System: CMake

UI/Debugging: Dear ImGui (optional/integration)
